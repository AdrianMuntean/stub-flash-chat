# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

We are going to learn how to incorporate Firebase with our Flutter app. We'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods

## What we will create

We’re going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
